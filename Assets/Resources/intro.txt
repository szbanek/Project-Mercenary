It all started five years ago. The Mercenaries Guild of planet Raal-Hal got an urgent message from the King of Sicion System. We were asked to land on the central planet of the system and rescue group of miners. We were informed that there was some kind of alien uprising going on.
It seemed like a simple extraction mission. Land, get miners, fly away. The Guild send five of our best men. I was among them.
Five people, highly train and able to work in very harsh conditions, to rescue simple miners. We thought it is more than enough. We never were so wrong.
We landed during the biggest sandstorm we've ever seen. We spent first week on board, not able to make even one step outside. One of us tried. Wind was stronger then him. We've never heard of him again.
When the storm passed, we went to miners camp. But we were to late. We found abandoned mine, and bones of workers, scattered in the valley. Our mission was done. We had nothing more to do.
As we came back to the ship, our telepath tried reaching the sentry we left near the ship. In vain. We found the body couple days later. It was burned by some kind of acid. We buried our friend. There were only three of us left.
Our communication was jammed. Our ship destroyed. But there were old communication centers on the planet. If we would activate them, maybe we can reach some passing ship. Maybe we can come back home. It is a slim chance, but it was our only option.
Five years passed. I spend my live looking for communication hubs and fighting aliens that try to kill me. I haven't talk to my crewmates in months. I don't even know, if they are still alive. But I still have hope, that some day I will be able to go back home.
